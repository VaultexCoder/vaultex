## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.9] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Android: tapping the "I have written down my seed phrase" label was a no-op.** `RegisterScreen.kt`'s `SeedStep` rendered the checkbox-plus-label as a `Row` where only the bare `Checkbox` itself handled `onCheckedChange`; the surrounding `Row` and the `Text` label had no click handler. A user tapping anywhere on the row except the tiny checkbox hit-target got nothing — including a disabled "Continue" button. Wrapped the `Row` in `Modifier.toggleable` with `role = Role.Checkbox` so the whole row is the hit-target and TalkBack reads it as a checkbox. Caught by `auth_flow` in the new Maestro suite.
- **Android: tapping anywhere off the search bar in Chats didn't dismiss the on-screen keyboard.** The Compose `OutlinedTextField` in `ChatsScreen` held focus until the user navigated away. The IME is a separate system service so it survives even an activity restart (`am force-stop` + `am start`), and the keyboard would stay up covering the bottom nav. Visible to real users as "the keyboard won't go away unless I exit the app"; visible to the acceptance suite as every flow-after-search failing because the bottom nav was hidden. Added `Modifier.clickable { focusManager.clearFocus() }` to the parent `Column` so any outside tap clears the focus.
- **Android: bottom-nav tab taps couldn't be reliably automated, and on Samsung devices were occasionally routed to the system Settings app.** `BottomNavBar.kt` now exposes each `NavigationBarItem`'s `testTag` (`nav_tab_chats`, `nav_tab_groups`, `nav_tab_calls`, `nav_tab_settings`) as an Android resource-id via `Modifier.semantics { testTagsAsResourceId = true }`. Accessibility tools and UI automation can now target tabs by stable id; the text-based fallback was matching Samsung's Edge Panel + Bixby surfaces that expose the same strings.
- **Website: download buttons were stuck on the previous release.** The marketing site's `useLatestRelease` hook fetches the latest GitHub release at runtime and rewrites the static download links, but the nginx CSP had `default-src 'self'` with no `connect-src` override, so the `fetch` to `https://api.github.com` was silently blocked. New CSP allows `connect-src 'self' https://api.github.com`. Effect: every published GitHub release now updates the download buttons within one page load — no website rebuild required.

### Added
- **Comprehensive acceptance test suite.** `docs/testing/acceptance-test-plan.md` rewritten to v2.0 (per-platform tags `[W]/[L]/[A]`, honest known-limitations table, Phase 15 cross-device scaffold). Three new tooling layers:
  - Android (Maestro on Windows): 10 flows covering register → groups MVP → 1:1 messaging → contacts → search → PIN setup → settings. All 10 green on a Samsung Tab S6 Lite over USB. The `auth_flow.yaml` exercises the full register-skip-PIN-start-messaging path with `clearState`; per-flow logs and Maestro debug screenshots land in `out/acceptance-<UTC>/android-maestro/`.
  - Windows desktop (PowerShell smoke + WebDriverIO via `tauri-driver`): `scripts/test/windows-smoke.ps1` launches the installed binary, waits for the main window, screenshots it, and kills cleanly (~5s end-to-end). `apps/desktop/e2e/` ships a WDIO + `tauri-driver` scaffold; session attach is verified.
  - Orchestrator: `scripts/test/run-acceptance.ps1` chains all three phases and writes `out/acceptance-<UTC>/summary.md` with PASS/FAIL per phase. Drives Maestro on Windows directly (no WSL hop) so it can see USB-connected Android devices via the Windows `adb` server. Auto-discovers a portable Temurin JDK 17 + Maestro distribution under `%USERPROFILE%`.

### Repo hygiene
- `/out/` and `apps/desktop/e2e/node_modules/` added to `.gitignore` so test artifacts don't bloat the repo.

Linux desktop bundle (.deb) still tracks v0.10.3 — built locally on the Linux laptop on next deploy cycle.

## [0.10.8] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **Android: Groups tab was a UI stub — tapping a group did nothing, and "create group" silently produced empty groups with no way to add members or send messages.** `GroupsScreen`'s list item had `onClick = { /* TODO: navigate to group chat */ }` and `CreateGroupDialog`'s confirm handler always passed `emptyList()` for members, so even when `GroupsViewModel.createGroup` was wired to insert members, none were ever provided. Wired a new `Screen.GroupChat` route ("group/{groupId}"), rewrote `CreateGroupDialog` as a contact multi-select with checkmark affordance, and added a full `GroupChatScreen` (TopAppBar back nav, member chips with per-member remove, message list with a 1.5s poll while open, send input bar, AddMemberDialog from the remaining contacts). `MessagingManager.sendGroupMessage(groupId, content)` fan-outs the encrypted envelope to every member's account_id with a stable `message_id` so receivers can dedupe.

Android only — desktop builds remain at 0.10.7.

## [0.10.7] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Android: app crashed when receiving a message from a peer not in the local contacts table.** `MessagingManager.onMessage` inserted a row whose `contact_id` had a `FOREIGN KEY` into `contacts`; if the sender wasn't in `contacts` (first-contact, identity-key reset, queue flush after contact removal) the insert threw `SQLiteConstraintException` on the worker thread and killed the process. Auto-create a placeholder contact named `"Unknown (xxxxxxxx)"` and wrap the worker body in a top-level catch so no future DB / decode / decryption error can ever take the process down again. Root cause of the user-reported cascade after the QR-screen incident.
- **Android: register left old vault data in place.** `AuthViewModel.register` never called `DatabaseProvider.wipeAll`, so contacts / messages / sessions / signed_prekeys / one_time_prekeys from the prior identity survived. Visible symptoms: old contacts under the new identity, and OTPK PK collision aborting the register half-way (identity written, prekeys not, leaving an unusable vault). Now wipes everything when an existing identity is found before starting register.
- **Android: register writes are now atomic.** Identity + signed prekey + OTPKs + passphrase hash are committed in a single `db.withTransaction { … }`. Reordered so passphrase hash writes FIRST inside the transaction — combined with the strict login check below, an OS-kill mid-register can no longer leave the vault in a state where login would silently authenticate.
- **Android: `login()` no longer silently authenticates when the passphrase hash is missing.** The pre-fix path skipped the hash check entirely when `settings.passphraseHash` was null and fell through to the authenticated branch. Now returns a clear "vault corrupted, create new identity" error instead.
- **Android: sealed-sender messages no longer all merge into one inbox.** `onSealedMessage` previously routed every sealed message to a single "unknown" contact key, crossing conversation boundaries. Until real unsealing is wired through the FFI, drop them with a log instead.
- **Desktop: group messages can now actually decrypt.** `send_group_message` encrypted each fan-out with `ad = member_identity_hex` while the receive path decrypts with `ad = account_id`, so the AEAD tag check always failed. Resolve members to their account_id before encrypting and use the resolved id as both the sessions key and the AD. Also include the missing `x3dh_init` field on the wire so the receiver's lazy session-create branch can run on the first group message to a freshly-added member.
- **Desktop: `MessagePayload.group_id` is now validated and rejected when malformed.** A peer could otherwise smuggle structured data (megabyte strings, control chars, IDs of groups the peer was kicked from) through the encrypted field. Reject anything that isn't either the placeholder or exactly 64 ASCII hex chars; on mismatch the message is treated as a 1:1 instead of polluting the local store.
- **Desktop: `MessagePayload`'s on-the-wire JSON shape no longer leaks group-vs-DM via padding bucket size.** The previous `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"` meant adding `group_id` pushed mid-sized DMs into the next padding bucket, exposing conversation type to an on-path observer. The padded serializer now always emits the field with a fixed-size placeholder for DMs so the wire shape is invariant.

### Security
- **FFI: negative length parameters can no longer trigger SIGSEGV or memory disclosure.** Every entry that took a `*const u8` + `i32 len` pair did `std::slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, len as usize)`; a malicious Java caller passing `len = -1` cast to `usize::MAX` and sliced into unmapped memory. `catch_unwind` does NOT catch SIGSEGV, so the process death was unrecoverable. Added `crate::error::validate_len(len, name)` which rejects negative values and anything above an 8 MiB hard ceiling; applied at every FFI entry point. Worst offender was `ffi_secure_random_bytes`, where the caller-controlled `len` drove BOTH the random draw AND the `copy_nonoverlapping` into the caller's buffer.

### Repo hygiene
- **`.gitattributes`** added to stop `core.autocrlf=true` on Windows from marking `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` as modified after every operation. Pin LF on source/config files; CRLF on `.bat`/`.cmd`/`.ps1`; binary on the obvious extensions. Followed by `git add --renormalize .` to bring the index into agreement.

Android only — desktop builds (Linux .deb, Windows .exe) remain at 0.10.3.

## [0.10.6] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Android: messages from server contacts were never delivered, even after registration was fixed.** The v0.10.5 release fixed Android's server-registration flow but the WebSocket connection that delivers messages was never opened — `NavGraph` materialized a `NetworkManager` ViewModel but never called `setCredentials` or `connect`, and `MessagingManager.networkManager` stayed `null`. The desktop-side "Contact added in local-only mode" symptom looked unfixed because the Android client never came online on the server. `NavGraph` now wires both managers and triggers `networkManager.connect(Config.DEFAULT_SERVER_URL)` on `isAuthenticated`. Verified end-to-end: desktop registered (account `39c9922e-…`), Android registered (account `6024dd19-…`), desktop adds Android via `/accounts/by-key` without falling back to local-only, desktop sends a Double Ratchet + sealed-sender message, server queues + delivers, Android logcat shows `MessagingManager onMessage senderId=39c9922e-… payloadLen=1098`.
- **Android: contact-add resolved a local UUID instead of the server's account_id** (also in v0.10.5 but worth restating). The fix in commit `68fee24` is now actually exercised on the wire by the WS fix above.

### Added
- **Website: GitHub Releases-backed download buttons with self-hosted fallback.** `useLatestRelease` fetches `/repos/VaultexCoder/vaultex/releases/latest` at runtime and the platform cards swap their URLs in once the API answers (8s budget; static `/downloads` URLs are used otherwise). Result: shipping a new binary version no longer requires rebuilding and redeploying the Astro site — just upload assets to a GitHub release and the marketing site picks them up automatically.

### Internal
- Diagnostic `Log.i` instrumentation added to `NavGraph`, `NetworkManager`, `WebSocketClient`, and `MessagingManager` covering connect lifecycle + server message arrival. Future WS regressions surface from logcat alone, no emulator/Maestro needed.

Android only — desktop builds (Linux .deb, Windows .exe) remain at 0.10.3.

## [0.10.5] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Android: default server URL was still `http://localhost:8080`.** The v0.10.3 release notes claimed the localhost default was switched to the production demo server, but that fix only touched `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/state.rs` and `apps/desktop/src/stores/networkStore.ts`. Three independent hardcoded defaults in `NetworkState`, `ApiClient`, and `SettingsState` on Android were missed. A fresh APK install therefore tried to reach `localhost:8080` on registration and silently failed with no UI hint. Centralized as `Config.DEFAULT_SERVER_URL = "https://api.vaultexchat.org"` so all three sites stay in sync going forward.

### Added
- **Android Settings → Test Connection button.** Pings `/api/v1/health` on the current server URL and shows a 4-second success / failure card. Removes the "is the server reachable?" guesswork that previously could only be answered by attempting registration.

Android only — desktop builds (Linux .deb, Windows .exe) remain at 0.10.3.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **Android: tapping "Generate Identity Key" crashed the app immediately.** `VaultexLib.INSTANCE`'s lazy `Native.load("vaultex_ffi", ...)` throws `UnsatisfiedLinkError` (a `java.lang.Error` subclass — not an `Exception`) when `libvaultex_ffi.so` is missing from the APK, and `AuthViewModel.register()`'s `catch (Exception)` blocks did not intercept Errors, so the LinkageError escaped the coroutine and tore down the process. Broadened the three relevant catches to `Throwable`, and now cross-compile + bundle `libvaultex_ffi.so` for `arm64-v8a` and `x86_64` so the FFI path actually works rather than just degrading gracefully.

Android only — desktop builds (Linux .deb, Windows .exe) remain at 0.10.3.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **Default server URL switched from localhost to the production demo server.** A fresh install on a new machine — without any environment variables set, without running `launch-alice.ps1` / `launch-bob.ps1` to override — no longer defaults to `http://localhost:8080` and gets stuck on the login screen with no way to reach Settings. Default is now `https://api.vaultexchat.org`. `VAULTEX_SERVER_URL` still overrides as before.

  Applies to both the Rust backend (`AppState::new` in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/state.rs`) and the React frontend (`networkStore` initial state in `apps/desktop/src/stores/networkStore.ts`). The two stayed in sync per the v0.10.2 `get_default_server_url` wiring.

  Long-term UX fix (allow editing the server URL from the login screen, before registration) is tracked in the project issue tracker — this release is the immediate unblock.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- **Frontend silently overrode env-derived server URL on first connect**: `networkStore` hardcoded `serverUrl: 'http://localhost:8080'` as its initial value, and `App.tsx` auto-connect passed that hardcoded value into `connect_to_server`, which OVERWRITES `AppState::server_url` (the value derived from `VAULTEX_SERVER_URL` at startup). The backend then made all session-establish HTTP calls against `localhost:8080`, so adding a contact returned `sessionStatus = "server_unreachable"` and no encrypted messages flowed. Same regression class as the three v0.10.1 fixes (silent local-mode fallback via a different code path).

  Fix: new `get_default_server_url` Tauri command that returns whatever the backend was configured with; `networkStore.initServerUrl()` reads it and adopts that value; `App.tsx` awaits `initServerUrl` before issuing `connect`. Surfaced by the new distributed E2E spec (`wdio.distributed.conf.ts`).

### Added
- **`get_default_server_url` Tauri command** so the frontend can stay in sync with the backend's resolved server URL without re-reading env vars (which a WebView can't see).

## [0.10.1] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- **Multi-client vault collision on a single OS user**: `default_data_dir()` now honors `VAULTEX_DATA_DIR` before the platform default, so two desktop instances launched on the same Windows (or any) OS user can hold distinct vaults instead of fighting over `%APPDATA%\vaultex`. The E2E orchestrator sets `VAULTEX_DATA_DIR` per client (kept `XDG_DATA_HOME` alongside for backward compat).
- **Silent registration fallback**: `register` previously fabricated a local UUID when the server rejected the request or was unreachable, leaving the UI showing "registered" against an account the server didn't know. Every later request (WS auth, by-key lookup, discoverability) then quietly 401'd. The command now returns an actionable error and persists nothing, so the user can fix the server URL and retry on a clean vault.
- **Default server URL ignored env**: `AppState::new` now reads `VAULTEX_SERVER_URL` first (falling back to `http://localhost:8080`), so a launcher / CI can point a client at the right server before any UI interaction.
- **Server Dockerfile build break** (#143): bumped builder image from `rust:1.77-bookworm` to `rust:1-bookworm`. The pinned 1.77 Cargo could not parse the workspace `Cargo.lock` (lock format v4, introduced in Cargo 1.78), so `docker compose build server` failed immediately.
- **Desktop Tauri version mismatch** (#144): bumped `@tauri-apps/api` from `^2.0.0` to `^2.11.0` so it tracks the Rust `tauri` crate (resolved to 2.11.x). The Tauri CLI rejects mismatched major/minor versions between the npm package and Rust crate, which broke `cargo tauri build` immediately with a version-mismatch error.

### Added
- **`scripts/launch-alice.ps1` / `launch-bob.ps1`**: Windows launcher scripts that pre-set `VAULTEX_DATA_DIR` and `VAULTEX_SERVER_URL` so two desktop clients can run side-by-side against a remote server without UI configuration. Accept `-Fresh` (wipe vault), `-Server <url>`, and `-Exe <path>` flags.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

#### Tester UX & Honest Connectivity (#136–#141)
- **Persistent dev-server scripts** (#136): `scripts/dev-server-up.{sh,ps1}` bring up the persistent Postgres + Redis stack and run the server natively; `dev-server-down.{sh,ps1}` tears it down (`--wipe` clears volumes). Persistent mode is now the documented default; demo mode prints a loud startup warning and is scoped to unit tests.
- **Reset Local Data** (#137): Settings → Danger Zone control that securely wipes the local SQLCipher database and zeroizes in-memory key material, then restarts on a fresh-account screen. Gated behind a typed `RESET` confirmation plus a backend confirm token.
- **Session-establish status surfacing** (#138): adding a contact now reports a typed `sessionStatus` and shows an actionable banner (account-not-found / server-unreachable / prekey-bundle-unavailable) instead of silently falling back to local-only mode. Re-adding a known contact is idempotent (dedupe on identity key); adding your own key is rejected.
- **`GET /api/v1/ping`** (#139): unauthenticated capability probe returning `{ service, version, min_client_version, capabilities }` so clients can confirm a URL is a real VAULTEX server before the WebSocket handshake.
- **Test Connection** (#140): a Settings → Server Connection diagnostic that probes ping + account registration and reports an honest verdict (unreachable / not-a-VAULTEX-server / reachable / account-registered / account-not-registered) with actionable copy, replacing the optimistic "connected".
- **Opt-in user discovery** (#141): default-off Settings → Privacy toggle to be findable by display name on a server, and a Browse Server dialog to find and add discoverable peers after confirming their safety-number fingerprint. Server adds authenticated set/read-back/list endpoints (rate-limited, suspended-filtered, self-excluded, LIKE-escaped) across both storage backends. End-to-end encryption is unchanged; opting out purges the stored metadata.

### Changed
- The server now applies SQLx migrations on startup (Postgres backend); discovery columns ship in both the migration and `infrastructure/postgres/init.sql`.
- `http_client::auth_get` signs over the request path without the query string, matching the server's auth middleware (enables authenticated GETs with query parameters).

### Fixed
- **Secure local-data wipe** (#137): `wipe_all_data` now scrubs the database file (`secure_delete`, `VACUUM`, WAL truncate) rather than only deleting rows — wiped identity keys and messages are no longer recoverable from the freelist/WAL given the non-secret bootstrap DB key. Also hardens the duress-PIN wipe and zeroes the retained rotation-grace prekey.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

#### Android P2P Transport (#94–#98)
- Full P2P transport manager with Bluetooth LE, WiFi Direct, and LAN/Bonjour backends, offline message queue, and a manual peer-connect path. Brings Android to parity with the desktop transport stack.
- Maestro UI automation framework (#93) for cross-device acceptance testing.
- QR code contact exchange (#91): generate and scan invite codes; QR scanner accepts `vaultex://` invite links and pre-fills the add-contact dialog.

#### Desktop UI
- QR code display and invite-link generation on the desktop client (matches Android UX).

#### Server / Infrastructure
- **Server containerization** (`infrastructure/docker-compose.prod.yml`): production-grade compose stack with Caddy TLS termination, Watchtower image auto-rollout, Postgres + Redis volumes.
- **Cloud deploy scaffolding** (`.gitlab-ci.yml`): `build-server-docker` pushes to GitLab Container Registry; manual `deploy-server` job SSH-deploys to a Hetzner-class host.
- **Linux bundle build script** (`scripts/build-linux-bundles.sh`, #131): one-command `.deb` + `.AppImage` production from `apps/desktop/src-tauri`, with prereq checks and artifact verification.

#### Documentation
- `docs/distribution/linux-tester-setup.md`: install/run instructions for non-dev Linux testers (`.deb` and `.AppImage` paths, data locations, troubleshooting).
- `docs/windows-build.md`: native Windows x64 build recipe (MSVC, libsodium, SQLCipher) producing the NSIS installer.
- `infrastructure/DEPLOYMENT.md`: prod deploy how-to (host setup, secrets, Watchtower, manual deploy, rollback, backups).
- `docs/operations/cloud-hosting-and-deploy-plan.md`: planning doc covering host selection (Hetzner CX22 recommended), co-hosting the marketing site, release-driven deployment automation, and the GitHub-vs-GitLab path for public security review.
- `docs/testing/peer-review-report.md`, `docs/testing/peer-review-report-p2p-transport.md`, `docs/testing/mobile-acceptance-test-report.md`: multi-expert peer-review reports for the iOS, P2P transport, and Android-acceptance sweeps.

### Fixed

#### iOS Peer Review (`bugfix/ios-peer-review`, !43)
- **FFI pointer ABI (iOS + Android)**: `ffi_identity_sign` / `ffi_identity_verify` now take `*const u8` / `*mut u8` instead of `*const [u8; 32]` / `*const [u8; 64]`. cbindgen previously lowered the array-pointer form into opaque Swift tuple types, forcing callers into unsafe `assumingMemoryBound` gymnastics; the Android JNA bindings were already using `ByteArray` and were silently mismatched.
- **iOS `VaultexCrypto.sign` / `verify`**: rewritten to pass arrays directly, removing ~20 lines of tuple-binding scaffolding per call site.
- **iOS `PersistenceController`**: Core Data load failure now `fatalError`s instead of silently `print`ing.
- **iOS `TransportType` enum**: `.wifi` → `.wifiDirect` (rawValue `"WIFI_DIRECT"`) to match Rust/Android wire format.
- **iOS `project.yml`**: removed stale `LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS` / `OTHER_LDFLAGS -lvaultex_ffi`; replaced deprecated `UILaunchStoryboardName` with `UILaunchScreen`.

#### Android
- **Passphrase verification**: store + verify Argon2id hash on login (matches desktop semantics).
- **P2P transport stability**: LAN server race condition, WiFi Direct discovery port + receiver issues, LAN data-port exchange + permissions, QR scanner accepting invite links.
- **Version-string source**: read from BuildConfig instead of hardcoded string (#92).

#### Website
- **CSP unblocked Google Fonts + inline hydration scripts** in `apps/website/nginx.conf` — interactive widgets (demo chat, comparison chart) now hydrate when served from the container.
- Added `apps/website/docker-compose.yml` for one-command local serving.

#### CI / Lint
- Unblock CI gates that were red on develop (rust-lint + frontend-lint).
- Prettier write across UI to unblock frontend-lint.

### Changed
- Tauri desktop crate: `cargo fmt` whitespace pass across `src-tauri` (no behavior change).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-23

#### Fixed

- **FFI pointer ABI (iOS + Android)**: `ffi_identity_sign` / `ffi_identity_verify` now take `*const u8` / `*mut u8` instead of `*const [u8; 32]` / `*const [u8; 64]`. cbindgen lowered the array-pointer form into opaque Swift tuple types (`(UInt8, UInt8, ... ×32)`), forcing callers into unsafe `assumingMemoryBound` gymnastics that were unidiomatic and fragile. The Android JNA bindings were already using `ByteArray` (which marshals to `*const u8`), so the old signature was actively mismatched there. The new signature is the same ABI both callers naturally produce.
- **iOS `VaultexCrypto.sign` / `verify`**: rewritten to pass arrays directly (Swift auto-converts `[UInt8]` to `UnsafePointer<UInt8>`), removing ~20 lines of tuple-binding scaffolding per call site.
- **iOS `PersistenceController`**: Core Data load failure now calls `fatalError` instead of silently `print`ing. A broken persistence stack cannot be recovered from mid-run — swallowing the error left the app in an undefined state. Will become user-visible recovery when SQLCipher lands (tracked for follow-up).
- **iOS `TransportType` enum**: `.wifi` (rawValue `"WIFI"`) renamed to `.wifiDirect` (rawValue `"WIFI_DIRECT"`) to match the Rust `TransportType::WifiDirect` and Android `TransportType.WIFI_DIRECT` wire format. Previously an iOS peer serializing a `PeerInfo` would emit `"WIFI"` which no other client recognized.
- **iOS `PeerDiscoveryView`**: updated `switch` to use the renamed `.wifiDirect` case (was a compile error after the rename).
- **iOS `project.yml`**: dropped stale `LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS` / `OTHER_LDFLAGS -lvaultex_ffi` (the FFI is now shipped as `VaultexFFI.xcframework` and linked via `dependencies:`, so the flat-file search path was dead config). Replaced deprecated `UILaunchStoryboardName: LaunchScreen` with modern `UILaunchScreen: {}` (required for iOS 14+ apps built with Xcode 12+).

#### Regenerated

- `apps/ios/VaultexApp/Crypto/include/vaultex_ffi.h` re-ran through cbindgen (`apps/ios/scripts/build-ffi.sh`) after the Rust signature change; now byte-identical to `cbindgen --config cbindgen.toml --crate vaultex-ffi`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-23

### Security

#### Auth Bug Fix (#90)
- **Passphrase verification**: Login now verifies passphrase against Argon2id hash stored during registration. Previously any passphrase >= 8 chars could access the app.
- **Media encryption**: Replaced XOR placeholder cipher with AES-256-GCM in Android MediaManager

#### Security Hardening (#39)
- **Screenshot prevention**: FLAG_SECURE on Android prevents screenshots and screen recording
- **Clipboard auto-clear**: Copied sensitive data auto-clears after 30 seconds
- **Root detection**: Warns user of rooted device, debugger, or emulator (non-blocking)
- **Secure storage**: Android Keystore wrapper for encrypted preferences

- **Duress wipe completion:** Duress PIN wipe now clears all in-memory state (stores, sessions, keys) in addition to database
- **PIN timing equalization:** PIN verification uses constant-time Argon2id comparison to prevent timing side-channels
- **Lock state enforcement:** App lock state is enforced on all Tauri commands, not just the frontend gate
- **Tor transport hardening:** SOCKS5 feature-gated, Tor client reuse to avoid circuit churn, connection timeouts, strict .onion address validation

### Fixed
- Double Ratchet skipped message keys now cached per Signal spec instead of discarded
- `ON CONFLICT` clause in `store_signed_prekey` corrected to match composite PK `(account_id, prekey_id)`
- `queued_messages` renamed to `message_queue` in `delete_account`
- `Signature::as_ref()` used for sodiumoxide compatibility
- Tauri config: removed duplicate `identifier` in bundle, removed invalid `title` prop, fixed icon refs
- Bidirectional X3DH sessions: receiver auto-creates session from X3DH init data in first message
- Associated data mismatch in `receive_message` — now uses own account_id to match sender's encryption
- "Rotate Now" button forces rotation instead of skipping when keys are fresh
- Contact selection uses proper Zustand primitive selectors (prevents re-render loops)
- Server URL default corrected to 8080 (matching server default)
- WebSocket event listeners wired up in App.tsx so incoming messages are received and decrypted
- Auto-connect WebSocket after authentication
- Tauri compile errors: private field access on IdentityKeyPair, missing `use tauri::Manager`, borrow lifetime issues, non-exhaustive match on SealedMessage variant
- All clippy warnings resolved (abs_diff, unused mut, fmt, assertions_on_constants)
- **Conflicting X3DH sessions**: Both parties independently initiating X3DH in `add_contact` created incompatible sender sessions. Fixed with lazy session creation — X3DH shared secret is computed in `add_contact` but the ratchet session is only created in `send_message` when the first message is sent. The receiver creates the matching session from X3DH init data in the received message. This ensures both parties share the same session.
- **Outgoing WebSocket channel dropped**: `let (tx, _rx)` immediately dropped the receiver half, silently losing all outgoing messages. Fixed by passing `rx` into the relay loop.
- **Duplicate WebSocket connections**: Multiple `connect()` calls spawned competing tasks causing rapid connect/disconnect storms. Fixed with a guard that returns early if already connected.
- **Tauri event system bypass**: Frontend `listen("message-received")` via dynamic import never fired even though `app.emit()` returned `Ok(())`. Fixed by decrypting messages directly in the Rust WebSocket handler (`handle_server_message` calls `receive_message_inner`) and emitting a `message-decrypted` event with plaintext. Added 3-second polling fallback via `pollAllMessages` for guaranteed delivery.
- **X3DH init data ignored on existing sessions**: `receive_message_inner` skipped processing X3DH init data if any session existed, preventing the receiver from creating the correct receiver session. Now always processes incoming X3DH init data, replacing any incompatible sender session.
- **Missing tracing subscriber**: All `tracing::info!` calls silently dropped. Added `tracing_subscriber::fmt().init()` in `lib.rs` and `println!` diagnostics at critical points.
- **Pending X3DH not cleared on logout**: Shared secrets in `pending_x3dh_init` were not zeroized during logout. Now cleared alongside other key material.
- Extracted `receive_message_inner` as a public function callable from both the Tauri command and the WebSocket handler
